        <div class="about">

            <p>Notice is made as a course assignment in the course JavaScript 2 at Noroff.
            </p>
            <p>Notice is a social media platform dedicated to noticing.

            <h2> why notice?</h2>

            <p>I was first inspired by a hypothesis in the field of second language acquisition, The Noticing
                Hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>“The Noticing Hypothesis – an hypothesis that input does not become intake for language learning unless
                it is noticed, that is, consciously registered (Schmidt, 1990, 2001) – has been around now for about two
                decades and continues to generate experimental studies, suggestions for L2 pedagogy, and controversy.”
                Schmidt, R. (2010).
            </p>
            <p>What role noticing plays in language learning is debated, but being introduced to this hypothesis was
                enough for me to be inspired by the concept of noticing in itself.
