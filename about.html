        <div class="about">

            <p>Notice is made as a course assignment in the course JavaScript 2 at Noroff.
            </p>
            <p>Notice is a social media platform dedicated to noticing.


            </p>

            <h2> why notice?</h2>

            <p>I was first inspired by a hypothesis in the field of second language acquisition, The Noticing
                Hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>“The Noticing Hypothesis – an hypothesis that input does not become intake for language learning unless
                it is noticed, that is, consciously registered (Schmidt, 1990, 2001) – has been around now for about two
                decades and continues to generate experimental studies, suggestions for L2 pedagogy, and controversy.”
                Schmidt, R. (2010).
            </p>
            <p>What role noticing plays in language learning is debated, but being introduced to this hypothesis was
                enough for me to be inspired by the concept of noticing in itself.
            </p>

            <h2>everyday noticing</h2>

            <p>What role does noticing play in our everyday lives? While researching for this social media application I
                googled «today I noticed», and discovered that I am not the first person outside the sphere of language
                learning to be fascinated by noticing. There is a whole little book called Today I Noticed by Deborah
                Huber. The authors approach is one more of mindfullness, which I can appreciate. I have used some quotes
                from her book as example posts in the feed.
            </p>
            <p>Personally, the last couple of weeks I have been noticing hair ties on the sidewalks. It started with me
                loosing a hair tie outside my door. Despite looking at it every day, I took me days to remember to bring
                it inside when I returned from walking my dog. And now I can’t help noticing all the hair ties out on
                the sidewalks. I don’t think there are more, I don’t think I didn’t see them before, but I didn’t notice
                them. And now I do and I can’t stop. As Deborah Huber puts it in her book: «Today I noticed that the
                more you notice the more you notice.».
            </p>

            <h2>use notice to share good moments</h2>

            <p>I think noticing the good in the everyday can be like the hair ties. When we start looking for good
                moments to document, the good moments magically start showing up more. When we look for something we are
                more likely to find it. I think we can to some extent guide our noticing, maybe by looking for good in
                our everyday, life actually becomes better? I am also very curious to know what other people notice
                while floating around in this existence, therefore this social form is perfect, even if the inspiration 
                is somewhat selfish. :)))
